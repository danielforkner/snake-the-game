make tick.nextLevel() function so that 
    - dialogue characters come back up (add .goUp css class)
    - boss change
    - gameState reset

use tick.nextLevel() to call the initial dialogue 
section when page is loaded for first time

replace switch statements with string literals like characters[`boss${gameState.currentBoss}`]. IF DOESNT WORK ASK QUESTION
